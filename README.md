# Snacky

Snacky is a small library to help you adding a [Snackbar](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/Snackbar.html) to your layout with ease. It was created because of my own needs and is inspired by [Toasty](https://github.com/GrenderG/Toasty). Snacky uses an easy builder pattern to build a Snackbar and gives you some template designs like ERROR, WARNING, INFO and SUCCESS as well as some customization options. See code samples below

:bangbang: As of version 1.1.4 Snacky is is only compatible with androidX and not longer with support library apps! :bangbang:

## Usage

Using Snacky is really simple. 

#### Initialisation

Start with `Snacky.builder()` to get a Builder. 

It is necessary to set an activity or View for the snackbar.

`.setView(View view)` will use the view for the snackbar to show, or you choose

`.setActivity(Activity activity)` which will automatically find the root view of the activity

#### Customization

most of them are self-explaining, all colors are *not* Resource Ids, but parsed colors, so use ContextCompat.getColor() if you want to use Resource-colors)

`.setBackgroundColor()` Color

`.setBackgroundResource()` Drawable resource

`.setText()` Charset or IntRes for text

`.setTextColor()` Color or ColorStateList

`.setTextSize()` size in SP or with ComplexUnit

`.setTextTypeface()` Typeface

`.setTextTypefaceStyle()` NORMAL, BOLD, ITALIC, BOLD_ITALIC from [Typeface](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Typeface.html)

`.setMaxLines()` max lines of Snackbar, off by default

`.centerText()` centers the text

`.setActionText()`

`.setActionTextColor()` Color or ColorStateList

`.setActionTextSize()`

`.setActionTextTypeface()`

`.setActionTextTypefaceStyle()` like .setTextTypefaceStyle()

`.setActionClickListener(View.OnClickListener)`

`.setDuration(Snacky.DURATION)` SHORT, LONG, INDEFINITE

`.setIcon()` Drawable to be shown, in my opinion ist best to use small drawables with 24dp size

#### Building

`.build()` gives you the Snackbar, but you can also use some predefined templates:

`.success()`

`.error()`

`.info()`

`.warning()`

All give you a snackbar object, but some set predefined values if you didn't customize them before.

#### Using the snackbar

After that you can handle the snackbar as you know it:

`.addCallback(SnackBar.Callback)` adds a callback to the snackbar

`.show()` shows the snackbar

## Example

See [ExampleActivity.java](https://github.com/matecode/Snacky/blob/master/app/src/main/java/de/mateware/snackysample/ExampleActivity.java) for a list of examples as shown in [Screenshots](#screenshots).

There you can also the see the right use of CoordinatorLayout and FloatingActionButton. For Snacky Builder just use the view from OnClickListener in FAB to animate it on click. 

## Installation

Snacky is published via Jitpack. Add this in your root `build.gradle` file (**not** your module `build.gradle` file):

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

Add this to your module's `build.gradle` file (make sure the version matches the JitPack badge above):

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.matecode:Snacky:1.1.5'
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0'
}
```
